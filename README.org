* math-at-point
** Summary

This package provides the command ~math-at-point~ for evaluating an arithmetic
expression at point using ~calc-eval~. Similar to ~quick-calc~, the result is
displayed in the minibuffer as well as copied into the kill ring.

** Installation

This package can be cloned from GitHub via the following command:

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/shankar2k/math-at-point.git
#+end_src

To start using it, place it somewhere in your Emacs load-path and add the line

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'math-at-point)
#+end_src

in your ~.emacs.d/init.el~ file. Then run <kbd>M-x math-at-point</kbd> to run
it. It is useful to create a global keybinding for ~math-at-point~ function. I recommend <kbd>C-z =</kbd>
