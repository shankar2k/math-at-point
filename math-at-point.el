;;; Commentary:

;; This package provide the function math-at-point that evaluates the
;; arithmetic expression at point using calc-eval, displays the result in the
;; minibuffer, copies the result into the kill ring, and can optionally be
;; inserted into the buffer after the expression.

;;; History:

;; Version 0.2 (2021-05-08):

;; - Added function `math-at-point-latex' for calculating LaTeX expressions at
;;   point
;; - Autodetect LaTeX expressions using org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p in
;;   ``math-at-point''
;; - Allow whitespace before or after "=" sign when insert is enabled
;; - Allow insert when there is "=" sign without a result after it

;; Version 0.1 (2021-05-06):

;; - Initial version
